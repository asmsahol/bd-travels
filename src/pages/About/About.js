          <h5>Climate</h5>
          <p>
            Bangladesh has a sub tropical monsoon climate. There are six seasons
            in a year: Winter (Dec-Jan), Spring (Feb-Mar), Summer (Apr-May),
            Monsoon (June-July), Autumn (Aug-Sep), and Late Autumn (Oct-Nov).
            The average temperature across the country usually ranges between 9C
            - 29C in winter months and between 21C - 34C during summer months.
            Annual rainfall varies from 160cm to 200cm in the West, 200cm to
            400cm in the Southeast and 250cm to 400cm in the Northeast. Cyclones
            above category three/four are uncommon (especially in the deep
            winter January through March)-- but while rare, can still bring
            widespread disruption as expected to infrastructure and power
            outages, especially in the coastal areas. The weather pattern is
            akin to the Gulf Coast in the United States (Alabama, Mississippi
            and Louisiana). The current weather can be seen by hitting the

          <h6>Ekushey:</h6>
          <p>
            National Mother Language Day - February 21. This day marks the
            anniversary of the martyrs that died in 1952 while protesting
            against the imposition of Urdu, in the name of Islam, as the
            mother-tongue. The uprisings to support Bangla as the mother
            language fueled the movement towards secular nationalism that
            culminated in independence in 1971. The holiday is marked by (one of
            the most colourful events in Asia) tributes to the martyrs by
            political leaders, intellectuals, poets, writers, artisans and
            singing beginning at one minute after midnight on the 21st.
